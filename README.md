# EDA-and-Statistical-Analysis-of-Mod-Clothing-Dataset

Overview 
This Statistics and EDA project is designed to train and test you on basic Data Exploratory and Statistical techniques used in the industry today. Apart from bringing you to speed with basic descriptive and inferential methods, you will also deep dive into a dataset and perform thorough cleaning and analysis in order to draw useful business insights from the data. This will expose you to what data scientists do most often–Exploratory Data Analysis. 


Goals

1. Using the core statistical theoretical concepts and knowledge to solve real time problem statements. 

2. Visualize a real time industry scenario where one can use these statistical concepts. 

3. Detailed data analysis and number crunching using statistics 

4. Exhaustive report building using EDA and visualization techniques to help the business take decisions using insights from the data 

Specifications 

Part -I is concept based and walks you through various concepts of descriptive statistics, probability distributions and inferential statistics including confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. 

Part -II on the other hand is dataset based and explore various data cleaning options, data analysis options and using EDA to derive deep and meaningful insights for the business 

PART-A ( Concept Based)

The following data represents the price in dollars for branded shirts in a website NuCloth 

23 30 20 27 44 26 35 20 29 29

PART-B ( Dataset Based)

STATS PROJECTS 

This dataset contains self-reported clothing-fit feedback from customers as well as other ide information like reviews, ratings, product categories, catalog sizes, customers’ measurements (etc.) from 2 websites: 
1. Mod Cloth
   
2. Rent the runway
    
  1. Mod Cloth sells women’s vintage clothing and accessories, from which the curator of the dataset collected data from three categories: dresses, tops, and bottoms.
    
  2. Rent The Run Way is a unique platform that allows women to rent clothes for various occasions; they collected data from several categories. 

Problem Statement: 

Let’s assume you are working as a data scientist in a newly started textile company. You have given a dataset that consists of most of the features related to the measurements, clothes types, Product ID, User ID, etc. Now you suppose to work the dataset to identify the patterns to understand the customer’s preferred brands and how the company needs to brand its products based on the patterns that you will be found them out. Explore all the EDA concepts you learned and use a statistical test to ensure that your identification is true or false.
